The small upvote and downvote nav buttons at the bottom right of the page are make with [lyket](https://lyket.dev).

{{< message class="warning" title="Optional" >}}
This step is optional. It is up to the user to decide whether to configure a upvote or not.
{{< /message >}}

This is a demo configuration.

```yaml
lyket:
    api_key: "xxbadsjflkdjwe"
    lyket_type: "updown"
```

To get the api token, sign up and copy the API token.
